          The aging population, driven by urbanization, low birth rates, and
          increasing life expectancy, has become a pressing global issue.
          However, developing countries face more complex challenges, including
          inadequate health care and resources, necessitating the development of
          new community models to meet the needs of old adults and improve their
          quality of life. To address the issue, this research proposes a new
          community model designed to foster community resilience that will
          enable old adults to access essential products as well as share their
          life experiences, abilities, and knowledge with the community through
          workshops. The latter will enhance old adults’ influence in the
          community, affirm their values, and promote intergenerational
          interaction and support. This approach can benefit all stakeholders
          and include elements to assist with activities of daily living
          (ADLs). At the core of this approach is  integrating offline
          communities with online communities through websites to enhance
          community resilience. The online component is a window to the offline
          feature, where some of the community's resources and support can be
          accessed through the online website.

          According to the survey, Chinese older adults’ population reached
          0.264 billion (above 60 years old) in 2020, accounting for 18.70% of
          the total Chinese population; The country has 0.19 billion older
          adults aged 65 and above, accounting for 13.50% of the total
          population, and because of the one-child policy in China, the
          proportion of empty nesters in China's older adults’ population could
          reach 90% by 2030.

          The Chinese one-child policy is the primary cause of the decrease in
          the fertility rate. The one-child policy, a formal initiative launched
          by the Chinese central government in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
          aimed to limit the vast majority of family groups in the nation to
          having just one child each.

          Community resilience is crucial in an aging society because older
          people are more susceptible to the effects of disasters and social
          problems.

          The platform is divided into three sections, with the first focusing
          on community descriptions and news, while the second - the services
          section - allows users to participate in activities and search for
          information in various media. The marketplace function enables users
          to trade products and add them to their accounts. The "Personal
          Account" section provides access to personal details, links to
          acquaintances and family members, and information about recent
          activities.
