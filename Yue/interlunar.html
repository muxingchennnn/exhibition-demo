          Interlunar provides a novel multimodal interaction on how couples can
          communicate about sex. The integration of TMC (Technology-mediated
          communication) and FtF(Face to Face) interaction aims to stimulate FtF
          conversation through TMC with its disinhibition effect to reduce the
          discomfort of difficult conversations, and allows users to communicate
          naturally in a relaxed game atmosphere.

          Sexual communication is the key to opening up a fulfilling and
          satisfying intimate relationship with your partner. It's not just
          about talking about sex, it's about really understanding each other's
          desires, boundaries, and needs in the bedroom. It's about creating a
          safe, nonjudgmental space where partners can express themselves openly
          and honestly without fear of rejection or misunderstanding. It's about
          actively listening to your partner, being empathetic, and validating
          their feelings. It's about expressing your desires confidently while
          respecting your partner's boundaries. It's about negotiating and
          finding a mutually satisfying solution. It's about building intimacy
          and connection through effective sexual communication. In short,
          better sexual communication is about fostering a healthy and
          satisfying sexual relationship based on mutual respect, understanding,
          and emotional intimacy.

        <span>Literature Review</span>
      </div>
      <div class="mid--3 text navigation-destination">
        <p>
          From Literature and research, I learned the reason why sexual
          communication is difficult for many people, because it is
          face-threatening, which means when people talk about messages about
          sex or stigmatized identities will threaten the positive social value
          a person claims for themselves during an interaction.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          One study found that technology-mediated communication plays an
          important role in communication among members of the stigmatized
          community of BDSM.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Technology results in less shame or embarrassment in disclosing
          stigmatized desires or aiding in moving past personal feelings of
          shyness. Discussing topics only through TMC can harm relationship
          satisfaction, while face-to-face discussions are noted to be more
          valuable for communication, especially for something as intimate as
          sex.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Research also found that Integration of TMC and FtF interaction was
          positively associated with relational satisfaction. At the same time,
          The very meaning of FtF interaction can be shaped by TMC.

      <div class="mid--4 text navigation-destination">
        <p>
          Interlunar, is an integration of TMC with FtF interactions.  it aims
          to stimulate FtF sexual communication through digital sexual
          communication.

        <br />
        <p>
          The game can be divided into four steps, the first three parts will be
          conducted through TMC, the first part is a couple co-edited question
          list through the app, the second part is reading the questions
          together from the screen, and then giving the answer. Last step is
          face-to-face conversation based on the question or the mismatched
          answers.

          This game was inspired by the popular American television show
          Newlyweds Game, which pits newlyweds against each other in a series of
          revealing rounds of questions to determine the degree to which spouses
          understand each other or do not.

        <br />
        <p>
          If you were asked directly if there had been any previous
          communication problems between you and your partner, it would be hard
          to recall for a while. Let the couple discover where they
          misunderstood each other in the game and the conversation will happen
          naturally.
