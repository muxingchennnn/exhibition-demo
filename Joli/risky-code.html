          Today, algorithmic decision-making is used in every field; they
          evaluate prisoners for parole, triage patients in emergency rooms, and
          predict where and when services might be needed. Increasingly people
          are asked to evaluate algorithmic decision-making without the
          expertise to effectively assess the consequences.

          is a digital workshop designed to increase the algorithmic literacy of
          workshop participants. The workshop uses information visualization to
          communicate underlying algorithmic mechanisms and engage participants
          in critical-thinking activities about algorithmic decision-making.

          First, the workshop teaches participants about underlying algorithmic
          mechanisms and multiple definitions of algorithmic fairness. Next,
          participants are asked to pick a scenario where algorithmic
          decision-making is used and brainstorm multiple stakeholder groups.
          Finally, participants assess how algorithmic decision-making is risker
          for some stakeholder groups than others by employing a visual taxonomy
          of algorithmic risk.

          brainstorm why there are underlying discrepancies between base rates
          in the underlying population. The image below shows a student
          facilitating the Risky Code workshop. The workshop is open source and
          intended to be navigated and facilitated by anyone interested in
          hosting a Risky Code workshop. Additional materials were developed to
          aid facilitators who may be interested in hosting a Risky Code
          workshop. All materials are hosted on <a href="#">google drive</a>,
          making them easily accessible to a workshop facilitator. Additional
          materials included are a workshop summary and learning goals, the
          workshop script, a slide deck, a glossary of terminology, and pre and
          post-surveys.

          Risky Code takes approximately is comprised of four learning modules,
          including, Algorithmic Prediction, Algorithmic Fairness, Stakeholder
          Mapping, and Deliberation. The first module, Algorithmic Prediction is
          intended increase participants understanding of underlying algorithmic
          mechanism.

        <br />

          The first module, Algorithmic Prediction, uses laundry as a metaphor
          to explain an algorithmic process. Workshop participants can update
          the statistical model and the predictive probability threshold on this
          page.

        <br />
        <p>
          The next three modules, are intended to increase participants ability
          to think critically about the social implications of algorithmic
          decision-making. The second module, Algorithmic Fairness, is leads
          participants through a series of activities to learn about multiple
          definitions of algorithmic fairness.

        <p>
          In the next module, Stakeholder Mapping, participants brainstorm
          stakeholders and create a network to visualize where stakeholder
          values overlap and diverge. Finally, in the last module, Deliberation,
          each stakeholder that participants identified in the Stakeholder
          Mapping process is shown re-rendered as an individual rather than as a
          network. Participants assess the risk of four different metrics,
          including, appropriate data use, technical risk, stakeholder values,
          and accountability, for each stakeholder group. Once they adjust the
          sliders the add each stakeholder to the graph which shows indicates
          overall risk.

          At the end of each module, Risky Code asks participants to take a
          moment to reflect on what they learned in the module. Participants are
          reminded of the moduleâ€™s learning outcomes before they are presented
          with several questions to discuss and reflect on before moving to the
          next module. Reflection is an important part of the experiential
          learning process.
