          “Seeing Sonic Styles” focuses on developing comparative visuals that
          show the playing styles of classical music pianists. This research
          examines and compares duo performances of Chopin Ballade No. 1 to
          identify the playing styles of the pianists. Chopin Ballade No.1 is a
          classical music piece composed by Chopin and is one of the most
          popular pieces by him. The intention is to bring a comparative aspect
          into music visualization. By analyzing the differences between piano
          play styles, it will benefit the audience to identified various
          interpretations among pianist and raise the question:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>What’s the standard / correct interpretation of this piece?</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This study will retrieve pianists’ live recordings using music
          information retrieval, which is then analyzed as a sound spectrum. The
          comparative visualization formed to describe the inner and external
          differences between pianists using sound data.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The intended audience for this piece is music students and
          professionals since this analysis of comparative performances will
          help them to recognize the various approaches taken by famous pianists
          to the same piece.

          I personally have a great interest in the classical music genre, as I
          have played piano myself. When I listen to different performances by
          various pianists, I can identify the pianist by only using my ear, but
          I cannot visually see the differences or talk clearly about them
          without additional evidence. The complicated nature behind pianists'
          playing styles is that they employ two layers of musical thoughts. The
          first layer of thought is from the composer. The composer builds the
          piece of music to reflect personal interests, cultural ideas or even
          social issues. The performers study the composer’s intention,
          notation, instructions and purpose to construct their own
          interpretations and naturally express those in personal styles. In
          this respect, the musical message they convey not only has unique
          perspectives of the composer, sometimes from long ago, but also from
          the moment of performance by a particular pianist. These are merged in
          each performance to convey a sound that reflects all the influences on
          the music. Through the dynamic markings on a manuscript or score and
          the liberty and creativity of each pianist’s playing they can even
          resonate with an audience hundreds of years after the original
          composition was created.

          These visualizations were created using TouchDesigner. The same audio
          file is used as the input, and the same FFT method is used to analyze
          the sound. When the audio is being played in parallel, each sound
          fragment is plotted to rotate. The keyboard's outer circles are the
          lower portions of the keyboards, while the inner circles indicate the
          higher frequency and higher notes on the keyboard. The whiteness of
          the hue represents intensity; a stronger whiteness in color indicates
          a more powerful attack on the keyboard. When comparing this to
          librosa's earlier research, the general analysis is the same but
          presented in a different format. In this distinct style, the material
          has been condensed and the focus is clearer due to the use of white
          visuals against a black background, which also makes for a more
          succinct illustration idea. For its dynamic and lively visual formats,
          it is a more appealing format for viewers to easily perceive how the
          sound is evolving, it also enables audiences who have no prior
          experience with music to experience the music. The animation also will
          create an atmosphere to narrate emotions.

          The final design prototype for this study incorporates a more complete
          pianists’ performance to raise the question:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Is there a standard interpretation on a music piece?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is apparent that piano pieces composed and performed over a century
          ago did not sound the same as with these modern pianists for reasons
          of factors like piano type and structure explained in the previous
          piano section.

          Here shown in the figure is the static version of the comparative
          animated visualization. Each circle is drawn in the same time span and
          the size and color refers to the amplitude and timbre at that specific
          time. The timbre or the brightness of sound is calculated by finding
          the centroid of frequency as the weighted mean of the frequencies
          present in the signal, determined using a Fourier transform, with
          their magnitudes as the weights.
