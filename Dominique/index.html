          The notion of home is universally understood. However, home is
          challenging to define and even more difficult to simulate in
          situations that necessitate it. Material and immaterial aspects of
          home are often geographically, culturally, familially, and
          linguistically situated. This research expands participants
          understanding by asking the question ‘what is home?’

          Participatory responses were used to create To:You, a physical and
          interactive workshop. The workshop explores the emotional dimensions
          of migration and displacement by inviting participants to reflect on
          their experience of home. Participants collectively build the network
          by reflecting, connecting and sharing their experiences.

          A design hypothesis was established as “to capture a moment where
          participants can reflect, share, and express their notion of home by
          ‘weaving’ connections to create a visualization that collectively
          defines the word home and designs a self-expressive way to create an
          engaging and networking public space for everyone.”

          Since ‘home’ is connected within all humans it makes our responses for
          home to be a wide diverse range of words and emotions associated with
          the notion of home. This thesis research process and case study
          connects back to the informal interviews and conversations where all
          people expressed their home not only as a physical infrastructure and
          exact location but others such as their personal, individual, past,
          and present experiences, level of emotions, and memories. It is an
          important moment for the audience to visually and physically show
          their reflections, connections and share their story without
          boundaries. All are a vital step for the design of student responses
          to what is home to take shape or form and size. These will create
          moments of creative expression, build relationships, and inspire other
          participants to build a networking environment among each other.

          Home can symbolize an object, memories, location, community, identity,
          language, food, tradition, music, sound and smell as the primary node
          and later on, it will branch out to many other words associated with
          these main nodes during your time of reflecting home. Cultural
          identity and memories are taken accountable through the sketching and
          shape of the project.

          Tools utilized in this project to come to reality are the
          characteristics of the choice of acrylic yarn. There are three yarn
          fiber types– animal fibers, plant fibers, and synthetic fibers.
          Synthetic fiber arts, belongs to acrylic yarn as the material part of
          the craftsmanship in this activity is a significant part of the
          concept and design of this project in connection to flexibility,
          texture, color, significance, and how feelings are embedded in them.
          Coming from the perspective of information design and data
          visualization, this design concept should encourage and inspire
          participants to immerse themselves in their connection to ‘home’ by
          using a unique method of creative expression, building relationships,
          and learning from other migrants their reflection and story of what is
          home.

          To:You are not only a toolkit for a workshop, it is meant for one as
          the participant to reflect, connect and share in this interactive and
          sensory experience for what is home. Participants gain an opportunity
          to explore and seek their own and other peoples’ way of thinking for
          home. This can inspire others to build a networking environment among
          each other. This toolkit will utilize the use of fiber and journaling
          for students who are in need to express their emotions, memories, and
          personal/individual experiences at any time they feel they are in
          need.
