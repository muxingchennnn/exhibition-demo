          The thesis project is about exploring the diversity of
          geo-visualization displays in terms of data physicalization. The
          choice of information/presentation/medium that designers made can be
          tightly connected to geographic maps and personal information
          delivery. Along with the explosion in information and new technology,
          we become accustomed to these digital products that make our lives
          easier and faster. When exploring daily updates, information, news in
          terms of the digital screen, I realized that the information around us
          is ignored. Our environment is full of information as well as
          cyberspace. So, I further studied the relationship between
          geo-visualization and their relative transformations, such as digital
          maps or map physicalizations, and I concluded that though in an
          information explosive time, the public desired integrating datasets
          with personal emotions. This thesis demonstrates the necessity of
          further study on geo-visualization data physicalization to arouse the
          public's empathy, evaluate the significance of data physicalization
          and enrich geo-visualization diversity.

          In recent years, traditional in-store shopping has faced great
          challenges and profound transformations, which contains significant
          untapped opportunities, especially in the design of its shopping
          experience. Offline shopping has many advantages that online shopping
          cannot achieve: Joy of In-store Shopping, Personalized Attention or
          Service, Touch and Try-on the Product, No Waiting for Delivery.

          “Fashion should be about self-expression and having fun, not how best
          to obscure your body.” The popular contemporary descriptions of bodies
          like Apple Shape, Pear Shape, or Strawberry Shape are still value
          judgments, but one that is expressed more gently. However, in this age
          of inclusivity and diversity, design interventions that can help
          people break the habit of such perceived flaws are needed.
